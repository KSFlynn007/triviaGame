## User Stories
1. As a user, I want to filter the categories and other selectors of the quiz.

```
Given the user has loaded the application
When they select any of the categories : number of question, question category and difficulty level
Then the responding filters will be applied to the questions fetched from the API
```

2. As a user, I want to see how I'm doing during the quiz.

```
Given the user has started the quiz
When they answer questions either true or false
Then a scorecount will update on the top of the screen
And the application will show the total amount of questions and current place in the quiz.
```
